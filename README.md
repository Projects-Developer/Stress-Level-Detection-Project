## Abstrack 
Chronic stress is a pervasive issue affecting mental and physical well-being. Early detection and intervention are crucial for preventing stress-related disorders. This project proposes an intelligent stress level detection system that utilizes multimodal sensing and machine learning algorithms to identify individuals' stress levels. Our system collects physiological and behavioral data, including heart rate, skin conductance, speech patterns, and facial expressions. Machine learning models are trained to recognize patterns and correlations between stress levels and physical/mental well-being. The system provides real-time feedback and personalized recommendations for stress management. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in accurately detecting stress levels and providing valuable insights for stress mitigation.

Keywords: Stress Level Detection, Multimodal Sensing, Machine Learning, Physiological Signals, Behavioral Data, Mental Health, Well-being.
